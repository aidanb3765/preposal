# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My plan is to make a game of sorts that will be either made through a simple design in python programming langauge or an IOS mobile game, but I haven't fully decided. For the game itself, I was still trying to determine between a game that one controlls through text prompts or keyboard entries or something like that of a board game (my niece wanted me to make the pretty pretty princess game).

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Currently I have no plan to collaborate with any other classmates.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I currently don't have any questions, but I am sure I will have a few as I finalize my ideas and start to integrate them into the project's programming.
