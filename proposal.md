# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Make Me A Princess Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Per a request from my nieces, this is a game that allows you to travel around a game board to collect pieces to make a princess.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will be comprised of various methods that include but are not limited to the game rules, the ability to create characters, the game board itself, and the entered commands of the user or player. To summarize what the game is, it is a board game where you travel around this circular board with various symbols that are on each space that indicate an accessory that you add to your character. The accessories include a ring, necklace, earrings, and a crown that are four different colors for each player. The game will be complete when you have obtained these four items. A few tricks placed on the gameboard will include a skip turn space and a black ring space that will be given to any player who lands on it, and if the player collected all four accessories while still holding the black ring, they lose the game. Similar to that of the pig game, there will be a choice of a maximum of four players and the ability to not enter any with the computer playing the game. Some features included in the software will be to open a separate window to display the game board and the pieces that will be used as collectable items and icons for the players too. It will be executed through IDLE and the window produced from running the software to allow gameplay. (The game to be recreated here is called Pretty Pretty Princess.)

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable for this project.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable for this project.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome will be to produce a game that follows the set rules and gives feedback to the user as they enter various determined commands.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is the software makes use of the character icons through the gameboard and allows user manipulation in the sense of progressing through the gameboard itself to stimulate a real-life game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will be to have a run of the game that allows player commands and fulfills the game rules with a player who wins in the end and is determined to be a princess.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps for this project will be looking into determining the correct game rules and begin to program them to be used. Then determining how I want to create or implement an image for the gameboard itself. Also, researching how to create characters and the required accessories that will be used as "tokens" for progressing through the gameboard, while allowing for a creative design that grabs a child's attention (in the end I want to allow my nieces to play it). I will look into example programs of gameplay that center around child games as well as the process of character and object creation whether through python or taking on another programming language/system to truly implement the ideas in a creative way. Overall creating a game that is interactive, but not too detail oriented due to time restrains on what I need to do versus when the project itself is due.
