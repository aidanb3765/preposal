Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

With this project, I have designed the background used as the game board as well as implemented multiple functions to be used as similar to playing the game. I have created a function for each of the spaces on the game board as well as images created for each player when they reach a specific space and obtain the space item. I have created functions that will implement each other and take the variables obtained as function parameters. I have also implemented runs of the game itself so far to check that the code is running properly.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The things I have yet to do so far are to create symbols for all spaces when they are reached by the "frog" or player and also a place that saves the variables so that a player is determined as the winner because so far the parts of the game continuously play even when the key items are obtained. Also, I have to determine how to implement the various functions in a way that is smooth and flowing.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The problems I have encountered so far are determining if I want to create an array to store the values or determine a point system of some nature to accurately give a winner. Also, finding out how to create a function that specifies the 12 various spaces on the game board so that they are not intertwining with each other in a negative way.
